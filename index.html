                As designers we usually turn to different sources of inspiration, and, well, sometimes the best inspiration lies right in
                front of us. With that in mind, we embarked on a special creativity mission nine years ago: to provide you
                with inspiring and unique desktop wallpapers every month. Wallpapers that are a bit more distinctive as the
                usual crowd and that are bound to fuel your ideas.
                <img width="600" height="350" src="http://files.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/sept-17/summer-ending/sept-17-summer-ending-full.png?_ga=2.22646459.1009660632.1504347569-2147392523.1502638934"
                    alt=""> <br> We are very thankful to all artists and designers who have contributed and are still
                diligently contributing to this mission, who challenge their artistic abilities each month anew to keep the
                steady stream of wallpapers flowing. This post features their artwork for September 2017. All wallpapers
                come in two versions — with and without a calendar — and can be downloaded for free. Time to freshen up your
                desktop!
